# 🚀 GravityRouge
A 2D space game developed in Unity, in which you move among asteroids in a weightless state, using a jetpack and a rope to survive. Your goal is to collect 10 energy cores between procedurally placed asteroids.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

- ✴️ **Jetpack with fuel system**  
  The player can push in the direction of W, A, S, D using a jetpack. Each push consumes fuel which regenerates over time.

- 🪢 **Grappling hook mechanic**  
  Right-click to shoot a rope toward a nearby asteroid. Use the mouse scroll to shorten or lengthen the rope. It breaks if overstretched!

- 🌌 **Asteroid gravity**
  Each asteroid platform exerts its own gravity field. The player is constantly pulled toward the closest one.

- 💥 **Deadly moving asteroids**  
  Asteroids fly in from the left and right edges of the screen. Getting hit results in a Game Over.

- 🎯 **Goal: Collect 10 energy cores**  
  Energy cores spawn in new positions each game – without overlapping with asteroids – and appear every 10 platforms.

- ⏱️ **Win timer**  
  After collecting the final energy core, a “YOU WIN!” panel appears along with your completion time.

## 🌀 Procedural Generation

- 🔁 **Each run is different**
  - Asteroid platforms are generated procedurally with random positions, spacing, and slight angles.

## 🎨 Visual & Effects

- 🌠 **Random space background**  
  Each playthrough features a randomly chosen animated space backdrop.

- 🌈 **Jetpack visual feedback**  
  Subtle visual flames appear in the direction of movement when using the jetpack.

- 🟥 **Grappling rope tension**  
The rope changes color as it tightens. If it turns red – it snaps!
